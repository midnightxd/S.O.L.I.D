Open窶田losed principle

In object-oriented programming, the open窶田losed principlestates
"software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be
open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an
entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.
The name open窶田losed principle has been used in two ways. Both ways use
generalizations (for instance, inheritance or delegate functions) to
resolve the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.
Open窶田losed principle is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design.
